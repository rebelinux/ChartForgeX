# ChartForgeX Topology

`ChartForgeX.Topology` is a reusable diagram family for deterministic, SVG-first topology views. It is intentionally product-neutral: ChartForgeX owns the model, validation, layout helpers, SVG rendering, and export-ready output; dashboard shells and data collection belong to host projects.

Use it for static or embeddable diagrams such as service maps, SQL/server dependency views, people/team relationship diagrams, network connectivity maps, replication meshes, geographic-style location views, and product-specific topology views supplied by host applications.

## Model

- `TopologyChart` contains viewport, layout mode, layout direction, groups, nodes, edges, legend, and theme.
- `TopologyGroup` represents a cluster, region, tier, team, location, or any other logical grouping.
- `TopologyNode` represents a logical object such as a server, database, service, endpoint, person, team, queue, network segment, or application.
- `TopologyEdge` represents a link, connection, dependency, replication path, trust, mapping, data flow, membership, or certificate chain.

Groups, nodes, and edges can carry `Href`, `Tooltip`, `CssClass`, `Metrics`, and `Metadata`. Edges can also carry explicit `Waypoints` for deterministic manual route bends around dense content. Use `SourcePort`, `TargetPort`, or `.WithEdgePorts(...)` when a route should attach to a specific node side such as hub-to-hub site links, vertical replication paths, or selected-object connectivity spokes. Use `RouteLane` or `.WithEdgeRouteLane(...)` to shift the generated orthogonal lane while keeping the endpoints anchored to their ports. Set `TopologyEdgeRouting.ObstacleAvoidingOrthogonal` when a route should score deterministic Manhattan lanes and prefer paths that avoid nearby node cards, group headers, labels, and already-routed edges. Nodes have an optional `Symbol` for short visual glyphs such as `SQL`, `API`, `DC`, `GC`, initials, or role abbreviations without baking those product roles into ChartForgeX enums. A node can override the chart-wide display mode with `DisplayMode` and can expose a short `Badge`, which is useful for collapsed clusters, counts, roles, or small site markers. The SVG renderer escapes text safely, emits native SVG `<title>` tooltips, emits stable `data-*` attributes including source/target group ids on grouped edges, and wraps linked elements in SVG anchors. Unsafe `javascript:`, `data:`, and `vbscript:` hrefs are skipped.

When `TopologyRenderOptions.IncludeDataAttributes` is enabled, which is the default, SVG output emits sanitized `data-cfx-meta-*` and `data-cfx-metric-*` attributes for groups, nodes, and edges. Caller-provided `CssClass` tokens are sanitized and appended to the matching SVG element so host wrappers can target product-specific states without ChartForgeX needing product-specific enums.

Edge labels are planned deterministically from the edge midpoint, then nudged away from node boxes and previously placed labels where possible. SVG edge labels expose `data-label-x` and `data-label-y` so host wrappers can inspect or target final label placement without running their own layout logic.

Use `TopologyView` to render a focused perspective from the same source model. A view can select groups, nodes, or edges, override title/subtitle text, and keep connected edges between visible nodes. This is intended for dashboard cards such as "selected region", "critical paths", or "affected links" without duplicating topology data.

Views can also be composed from generic selectors instead of hardcoded ids. Use `NodeKinds`, `EdgeKinds`, and `HealthStatuses` to render product-neutral perspectives such as dependencies, connectivity, warning paths, or critical links. Use `TopologyView.AroundNode("api", depth: 1)` or `FocusNodeIds` with `NeighborDepth` to render a selected-node connectivity view; `IncludeIncomingEdges` and `IncludeOutgoingEdges` control traversal direction. Matching filtered edges keep their endpoints visible even when endpoint nodes have a different health status, which keeps views such as "critical links" readable.

`TopologyLegend.Default()` is intentionally product-neutral and only adds health-status entries. Add node-kind and edge-kind legend entries explicitly for the domain being rendered, for example service dependencies, transport links, replication paths, mappings, ownership, or team relationships. Legend entries can also use `symbol` overrides.

Set `TopologyRenderOptions.LegendMode` to `Auto`, `AutoWhenMissing`, or `Merge` when the renderer should infer legend items from the statuses, node kinds, node symbols, and edge kinds that are actually present in the chart.

## Layout

V1 layouts are deterministic and report-friendly:

- `Manual` uses explicit coordinates.
- `GroupGrid` arranges groups in a grid and places unpositioned nodes inside their groups.
- `HubAndSpoke` places a hub and branch nodes inside each group.
- `Layered` uses node kind or `Metadata["layer"]` for simple top-to-bottom or left-to-right layers.
- `Matrix` places nodes in a deterministic grid.
- `DenseGrouped` places groups in packed panels and lays out each group with a hub row plus deterministic branch rows for dense site-link, replication, and subnet maps. Use `.WithGroupLayout("site-id", TopologyGroupLayoutPolicy.Grid)`, `PairRows`, `MiniMesh`, or `CollapsedDots` when a panel should render a subnet grid, replication-pair rows, dense partner mesh, or many compact site dots. SVG group wrappers expose both `data-group-layout-policy` and `data-group-applied-layout-policy`, so hosts can tell requested `Auto` policy apart from the resolved policy. Inter-group dense edges get outside-facing ports and deterministic lanes when the caller has not already set ports or `RouteLane`; SVG edge wrappers expose inferred values through `data-edge-layout-inference`.
- `Geographic` projects typed node and group longitude/latitude coordinates into the topology viewport using `ChartMapViewport` and the same equirectangular coordinate model used by dotted maps. Use `.WithMapViewport(ChartMapViewport.World())`, `.WithNodeCoordinates("site-id", longitude, latitude)`, and `.WithGroupCoordinates("region-id", longitude, latitude)` for map-like region/site topology. SVG and PNG include a geographic frame, graticule lines, generated land-dot background, regional boundary/land-area shapes when the selected viewport has boundary geometry, and curved map-arc links for `TopologyEdgeRouting.Curved`. SVG also exposes `data-cfx-projection`, viewport bounds, `data-node-longitude`, `data-node-latitude`, `data-group-longitude`, `data-group-latitude`, `*-geo-visible` flags for clamped out-of-viewport coordinates, and `data-route-curve` / `data-route-control-*` diagnostics for geographic route arcs.

Set `TopologyChart.LayoutDirection` or use `.WithLayout(TopologyLayoutMode.Layered, TopologyLayoutDirection.LeftToRight)` when a hierarchy should read horizontally, such as namespace -> service -> database, source -> processor -> sink, or selected object -> connected dependencies.

After layout, ChartForgeX runs a deterministic normalization pass. It keeps nodes out of group headers, separates overlapping sibling nodes, expands groups around their members, shifts negative or title-overlapping manual coordinates and edge waypoints into the report-safe area, and expands the viewport when content, explicit edge routes, or the legend would otherwise be clipped. This is a safety net for reusable chart builders; callers should still provide intentional coordinates when using `Manual`.

For dense replication, subnet, and connectivity views, combine explicit ports with route lanes before reaching for manual waypoints:

```csharp
chart
    .AddEdge("emea-apac", "emea-hub", "apac-hub", "82 ms", TopologyEdgeKind.Link, TopologyHealthStatus.Warning, TopologyDirection.Bidirectional)
    .WithEdgePorts("emea-apac", TopologyEdgePort.Right, TopologyEdgePort.Left)
    .AddEdge("fra-sin", "fra-dc2", "sin-dc1", "238 ms", TopologyEdgeKind.Replication, TopologyHealthStatus.Critical, TopologyDirection.Forward, TopologyEdgeRouting.ObstacleAvoidingOrthogonal)
    .WithEdgePorts("fra-sin", TopologyEdgePort.Bottom, TopologyEdgePort.Top)
    .WithEdgeRouteLane("fra-sin", 24);
```

Obstacle-aware routes are opt-in so existing reports stay stable. SVG output exposes `data-route-strategy`, `data-route-corridor`, `data-route-candidate-count`, `data-route-fallback-reason`, `data-route-segment-count`, `data-route-obstacle-hits`, `data-route-label-obstacle-hits`, and `data-route-overlap-score` on edge wrappers so host dashboards and tests can inspect how a route was planned.

Force-directed and physics layouts are intentionally not implemented in v1.

## Rendering

```csharp
using ChartForgeX.Topology;

var chart = TopologyChart.Create()
    .WithId("service-map")
    .WithTitle("Service Dependency Map")
    .WithLayout(TopologyLayoutMode.Layered, TopologyLayoutDirection.LeftToRight)
    .WithLegend(TopologyLegend.Default()
        .AddNodeKind("Service", TopologyNodeKind.Service, symbol: "API")
        .AddNodeKind("Database", TopologyNodeKind.Database, symbol: "SQL")
        .AddEdgeKind("Dependency", TopologyEdgeKind.Dependency))
    .AddNode("api", "API", 0, 0, TopologyNodeKind.Service, TopologyHealthStatus.Healthy, symbol: "API")
    .AddNode("database", "Database", 0, 0, TopologyNodeKind.Database, TopologyHealthStatus.Warning, symbol: "SQL")
    .AddEdge("api-database", "api", "database", "32 ms", TopologyEdgeKind.Dependency, TopologyHealthStatus.Warning, TopologyDirection.Forward);

chart.Nodes[0].Metadata["layer"] = "1";
chart.Nodes[1].Metadata["layer"] = "2";

var svg = chart.ToSvg();
chart.SaveSvg("service-map.svg");
chart.SaveHtml("service-map.html");
chart.SavePng("service-map.png");

var emeaOnly = chart.ToSvg(new TopologyRenderOptions {
    View = new TopologyView {
        Id = "emea",
        Title = "EMEA Topology",
        GroupIds = { "EMEA" }
    }
});

var selectedService = chart.ToSvg(new TopologyRenderOptions {
    View = TopologyView.AroundNode("api", depth: 1)
});

var criticalDependencies = chart.ToSvg(new TopologyRenderOptions {
    View = new TopologyView {
        EdgeKinds = { TopologyEdgeKind.Dependency },
        HealthStatuses = { TopologyHealthStatus.Critical }
    }
});

var denseSvg = chart.ToSvg(TopologyRenderOptions.FromPreset(TopologyViewPreset.Compact));
var offenderSvg = chart.ToSvg(TopologyRenderOptions.FromPreset(TopologyViewPreset.Offenders));

var metricSvg = chart.ToSvg(new TopologyRenderOptions {
    Preset = TopologyViewPreset.MetricLabels,
    EdgeLabelMetricKey = "lag",
    EdgeSecondaryLabelMetricKey = "queue",
    LegendMode = TopologyLegendMode.Merge
});
```

`TopologySvgRenderer` outputs a complete standalone SVG with `viewBox`, `defs`, scoped CSS, groups below edges, edge labels above edges, nodes above labels, status badges, optional legends, and accessibility metadata. `TopologyPngRenderer` draws the same model through ChartForgeX's dependency-free raster canvas for report exports. `TopologyHtmlRenderer` wraps the generated SVG in a neutral `.cfx-topology-wrapper` div with chart metadata and, by default for complete pages, a tiny interaction script that marks clicked groups, nodes, or edges and dispatches `cfx-topology-select` / `cfx-topology-clear` events. Selection details include the selected id, kind, status, metadata, metrics, group/node/edge context, route diagnostics, geographic route-arc diagnostics, and related node/edge/group ids so HtmlForgeX or TestimoX can populate inspector panels without reparsing SVG markup. Selectable topology elements are keyboard focusable, Enter/Space activates selection, Escape clears selection, pointer/focus hover highlights related elements and dispatches `cfx-topology-hover` / `cfx-topology-hover-clear`, and hosts can dispatch `cfx-topology-set-selection` or `cfx-topology-clear-selection` on the wrapper to control state. Set `TopologyRenderOptions.EnableHtmlViewportControls = true` to add opt-in zoom, pan, wheel-zoom, reset, `cfx-topology-viewport`, `cfx-topology-set-viewport`, and `cfx-topology-reset-viewport` support for large diagrams. Set `TopologyRenderOptions.EnableHtmlInteractions = false` when a host wants a purely static page or will provide all behavior itself.

`TopologyRenderOptions` also supports reusable render presets and node display modes:

- `TopologyViewPreset.Grouped`, `Ungrouped`, `Connectivity`, `Dependency`, `Offenders`, `Compact`, and `MetricLabels` compose common static dashboard perspectives.
- `TopologyNodeDisplayMode.Card`, `CompactCard`, `Tile`, `Pill`, `Icon`, and `Dot` let the same model render as full report cards, screenshot-style site tiles, or dense dashboard summaries.
- Individual nodes can set `DisplayMode` or use `.WithNodeDisplay("node-id", TopologyNodeDisplayMode.Dot, badge: "+12")` so a single topology can mix full cards, compact markers, icons, and collapsed count badges.
- Node kinds can use `.WithNodesDisplay(TopologyNodeKind.Server, TopologyNodeDisplayMode.Card)` so a host can keep branches as compact tiles while rendering servers, bridgeheads, databases, or selected assets as wider cards.
- `IncludeTileSubtitles` adds compact subtitle chips below tile labels for subnet CIDRs, roles, queue labels, or site metadata when a dense map needs those details visible.
- `CardSubtitleMode = TopologyCardSubtitleMode.Chip` renders card and compact-card subtitles as status-like chips inside node cards for bridgeheads, servers, selected assets, or health labels.
- `TopologyRenderOptions.IncludeEdgeLabelBackplates` can be disabled for route-label styling closer to network maps where latency labels sit directly on the route.
- Groups can carry a short `Symbol`; the built-in `region` / `globe` symbol renders a small geographic mark in the group header.
- Groups can set `.WithGroupColor("group-id", "#8B5CF6")` to keep region or product identity color independent from health status; the health remains in `data-cfx-status`.
- Nodes can set `.WithNodeColor("node-id", "#2563EB")` for the same identity/status split on hubs, selected sites, collapsed clusters, or service nodes.
- Render options can set `.WithSelectedGroup("region-id")`, `.WithSelectedNode("node-id")`, and `.WithSelectedEdge("edge-id")` when a static export should show the currently selected site, region, or path without filtering or dimming other elements. SVG emits `data-cfx-selected` and selected classes; PNG renders matching selected outlines.
- Edges can set `.WithEdgeLineStyle("edge-id", TopologyEdgeLineStyle.Dashed)` or `Dotted` when relationship type should control line style separately from health status.
- Edges can be marked with `.WithEdgeMuted("edge-id")` when they represent quiet internal structure, such as hub-to-branch hierarchy lines, while health-bearing site links remain status-colored.
- `EdgeLabelMetricKey`, `EdgeSecondaryLabelMetricKey`, and `EdgeTertiaryLabelMetricKey` allow hosts to switch route labels from default edge text to metrics such as `transport`, `cost`, `lag`, `queue`, `owner`, or `lastSuccess`; `.WithEdgeMetricLabels("lag", "queue", "transport")` applies the stacked metric label keys in one call.

## Host Boundaries

HtmlForgeX can later provide cards, toolbars, sidebars, filters, tabs, inspectors, and event panels around the SVG. TestimoX or another product can later collect and calculate product-specific health, then convert that data into `TopologyChart`. ChartForgeX should not connect to Active Directory, hardcode TestimoX data, or implement dashboard page layout.

The example console app writes sample diagrams to `artifacts/topology-demo/` and to the normal generated example output folder. They intentionally use sample data only and demonstrate how a host can map its own product concepts onto the generic topology model:

- `site-topology.svg`
- `replication-mesh.svg`
- `subnets-site-links.svg`
- `geographic-topology.svg`
- `dc-connectivity.svg`
- `service-dependency.svg`
- `visual-geographic-topology-map.svg`
- `service-dependency-api-neighbors-view.svg`
- `service-dependency-critical-dependencies-view.svg`
- matching `.png` and `.html` files
- focused view examples for EMEA, selected-node neighbors, DC-level replication, offender highlighting, compact service dependencies, critical dependencies, and critical replication paths
- `index.html`
